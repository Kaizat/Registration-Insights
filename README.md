# Registration-Insights
This project analyzed vehicle registration trends by brand, model, color, state, and fuel type. A Power BI dashboard was developed using data from January to December 2024 to highlight key trends. The analysis identified the top brand, the top 10 registered models, and the most preferred fuel type in the Malaysian market.

This dataset contains the actual transactional records of all cars registered with the Road Transport Department (JPJ) since 2000, excluding any personal identifiable data (note: no personal data as defined by Act 709 is ever handled or even received by the data.gov.my team in the process of producing this dataset). Under Malaysian law, all vehicles must be registered with JPJ and be assigned a registration plate number before they can be used on the road.

While there has been cleaning and validation conducted prior to publication, no other amendment or aggregation has been performed; each row in the dataset represents 1 registration transaction. This is the most granular form of the data, i.e. the single source of truth from which all other car registration statistics are derived, including those shown on data.gov.my.
